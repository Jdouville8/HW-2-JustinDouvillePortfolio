# Objective

To create a website from scratch using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. This website is meant to be responsive and composed of well positioned elements.

# Execution

- Used cards to create the containers holding content within each HTML file.
- The links on the nav bar are how you engage in portfolio page navigation
- I struggled with proper use of grid especially in regards to nested columns and formatting the but was able to reach a satisfying result.

# Features

Nav Bar contents - A main page reached by clicking on my name with some information about me and my goals as a programmer - A portfolio page displaying cover art for music releases - A contact page that allows you to submit information

# Credits

- The Navbar and Card components were taken from Bootstrap documentation and edited to fit the styling of my website
